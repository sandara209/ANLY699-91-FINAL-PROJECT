suicide after sending a disgruntled email to CEO Jeff Bezos and hundreds of his co-workers, put the high-tech 
giant, Amazon under spot light. People started to notice the importance of caring the mental health of tech 
workers. This study reviews the survey of mental health in tech workers in 2016 from OSMI. First, the general 
information of the survey is introduced. Followed by introduction is the literature reviews about the field of 
mental health and previous studies about mental health. Next, methodology of analyzing the survey is described.

regression models in this study. After methodology, the result is being discussed, mainly about the relationship
between mental illness and other variables. Followed by that, some treatment method and advice are introduced.
